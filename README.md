# sauce

This is a sailsjs configuration with a few things implemented: 
- user system (passport)
- node mailer/mail script
- SASS support - **on Windows, you need to install Ruby for this to work.** There might be a `gem install sass` involved there too.

`views/layout.ejs` is the main page wrapper. It gets updated with files from the `assets/` folder automatically.
